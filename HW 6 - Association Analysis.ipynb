    "\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm in data mining. It is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. In this part, you'll be implementing this algorithm for generating the itemsets that occur enough times to meet the `min_sup` threshold.\n",

    "- Use the `frozenset` data structure in Python, which is similar to `set` in functionality, to represent the itemsets, because `frozenset` is an immutable (hashable) data structure. You can maintain a dictionary that maps from the itemset (a `frozenset`) to its support count."
